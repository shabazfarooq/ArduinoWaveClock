DESCRIPTION
-----------
    This is a intuitive alarm clock based on the Arduino platform. The idea is
    simple, the device acts as a standard alarm clock, however with one minor
    modification. The snooze and alarm shutoff features have been programmed to
    respond based on a waving gesture of the hand over the device.

    When the alarm rings, the user can activate the snooze mode by waving their
    hand between 0 and 10 inches over the device.

    If the user wants to turn the alarm ringer completely off, he or she need 
    to wavenntheir hand above the clock between 10 and 40 inches.
